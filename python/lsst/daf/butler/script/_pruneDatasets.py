    Parameters
    ----------
    tables : `list` [``astropy.table.table``], optional
        The astropy tables that will be or were deleted, by default None.
    state : ``PruneDatasetsResult.State``, optional
        The initial state of execution of the action, if `None` the result
        state is ``INIT``, by default None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    tables
        Same as in Parameters.
    state : ``PruneDatasetsResult.State``
        The current state of the action.
    onConfirmation : `Callable[None, None]`
        The function to call to perform the action if the caller wants to
        confirm the tables before performing the action.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo : `str`
        URI to the location of the repo or URI to a config file describing the
        repo and its location.
    collections : iterable [`str`]
        A list of glob-style search string that identify the collections to
        search for.
    datasets : iterable [`str`]
        A list of glob-style search string that identify the dataset type names
        to search for.
    where : `str`
        A string expression similar to a SQL WHERE clause.  May involve any
        column of a dimension table or (as a shortcut for the primary key
        column of a dimension table) dimension name.
    find_all : `bool`
        If False, for each result data ID, will only delete the dataset from
        the first collection in which a dataset of that dataset type appears
        (according to the order of ``collections`` passed in).  If used,
        ``collections`` must specify at least one expression and must not
        contain wildcards. This is the inverse of ``QueryDataset``'s find_first
        option.
    disassociate_tags : `list` [`str`]
        TAGGED collections to disassociate the datasets from. If not `None`
        then ``purge_run`` must be `None`.
    unstore : `bool`
        Same as the unstore argument to ``Butler.pruneDatasets``.
    purge_run : `str`
        Completely remove the dataset from this run in the ``Registry``.
    dry_run : `bool`
        Get results for what would be removed but do not remove.
    confirm : `bool`
        Get results for what would be removed and return the results for
        display & confirmation, with a completion function to run after
        confirmation.

    Returns
    -------
    results : ``PruneDatasetsResult``
        A data structure that contains information about datasets for removal,
        removal status, and options to continue in some cases.
